# WinFilters
A Windows Winforms program to visualize various combinations of electrical/acoustic filters, lowpass, highpass and summed response in graphical form. It's primarily for acoustic filters as might be used in 2-way loudspeaker systems. Written in C#, it makes use of Zedgraph, the open source graphing package.
